/*
Given an integer x, find the square root of x. 
If x is not a perfect square, then return floor(âˆšx).

 
Example 1:
Input:
x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 5 is not a perfect 
square, floor of square_root of 5 is 2.


Example 2:
Input:
x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: Since, 4 is a perfect 
square, so its square root is 2.
 

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. 
The task is to complete the function floorSqrt() 
which takes x as the input parameter and return its square root.

Note: Try Solving the question without using sqrt Function.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)
